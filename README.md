This is a major overhaul of my term project in SDS 335: Introduction to Scientific Programming, at UT-Austin in Spring 2020.
How apropos it was making this right as COVID emerged. What a time.

Old repo (with my report plus some miscellaneous Fortran):

This code doesn't build yet, but when it does, it will be via CMake.
